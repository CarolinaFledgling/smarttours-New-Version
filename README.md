This project is made independently and without any starter code. It is made with HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript and plugin Slick.
While creating the website I solved a many problems and learned many new things.

## General info
The project required me to build a simple landing page for Travel agency

- Vanilla JavaScript implementation of smart navigation and animate on scroll ðŸš€
- Perfect scores on accessibility, performance, best practices and SEO ðŸš€

## Design What I did:
- Tried to keep design balanced

- Added white space around elements to make them stand out.
