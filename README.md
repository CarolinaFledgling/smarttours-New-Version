# Smarttours-New-Version

## Description 
This project is made independently and without any starter code. It is made with HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript and plugin Slick.
While creating the website I solved a many problems and learned many new things.

- Perfect scores on accessibility, performance, best practices and SEO 🚀
- JavaScript Form Validation 🚀

## Design What I did:
- Tried to keep design balanced 
- Picked three base colors
- Picked the right font ( font is key to having a good website design,  Be mindful of the load times, remember about readable contrast)
- Added white space around elements to make them stand out.
